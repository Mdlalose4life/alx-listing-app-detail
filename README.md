# ALX Listing App

## Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a simplified Airbnb-style listing page that showcases various property cards with essential details and action buttons. The goal of this project is to practice building reusable React components using TypeScript, while following clean project structure conventions and maintaining scalability for future development.

## Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the main directories in the project:

- **`components/`**: Contains all the reusable React components used throughout the application.
  - **`common/`**: Includes shared UI components like `Card.tsx` and `Button.tsx` that are used across different pages.
  
- **`interfaces/`**: Stores all TypeScript interface definitions. Centralizing these here ensures type safety and consistency across components.

- **`constants/`**: Holds static data, configuration settings, and reusable strings like API URLs and UI labels.

- **`public/assets/`**: This directory is used for storing static files such as images, icons, or fonts that are publicly accessible.
